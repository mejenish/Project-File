This is my very first FULL assignment assigned by our respected sir. My job is to complete the work on the eCommerce website which genre I've selected to work on. So, I've to do work on the component procedure where every CSS is separated in different CSS files for the distribution of effort. So, I can easily changes each separate parts afterwards.

Works I've to do at the start: [FIGMA]
Have a good working design on Figma (complete home layout must be designed)
Each pages looks must be designed completely by me to ensure the internal post's structure
All the detailing pages like home, about us, contact us, faq etc must be designed separately
